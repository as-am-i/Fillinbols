`Fillinbols` is a simple arithmetic calculation game for iOS.

## How to play
* User can select a level from EASY, NORMAL, HARD, and DIE HARD, which has different operator symbols according to each level, and see 10 fill-in calculations to answer by tapping on the symbols (That's why I named it Fillinbols!).
* There are obvious signs displaying tick or cross mark over fomulas, in order to check if the symbol user chose is correct or wrong.
* User would get scores when he answer correctly by left time for each calculation, or lose 1 point everytime he clicks on the wrong symbols.
* Each calculation has  seconds and next fomula shows up when time is up.
* After all calculations finished, user can get his final score. Congratulations!
* User will be asked for use name to display in the rank only when the score is in the top 5 of all the results (The results and user names are stored and shown only on his device. User can skip entering his name and default name will be saved if lazy). 
* Ok, it's time to start a new game.
